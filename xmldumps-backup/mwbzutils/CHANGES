recompressxml now compresses output file based on the name; if it writes
to stdout, then no compression will be done. This is a breaking change!

If you want your code to remain compatible, you may either remain
with version 0.0.8 or add a pipeline to caller thus:

recompressxml (args) | bzip2 > outputfile.
