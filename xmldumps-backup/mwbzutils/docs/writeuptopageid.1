writeuptopageid \- Write range of page content from MediaWiki XML input
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a MediaWiki XML file from the specified path or from stdin and writes a range
of pages from the file to stdout, starting with and including the startpageid, up to
but not including the endpageid.
This program can be used in processing XML dump files that were only partially
written, as well as in writing partial stub files for reruns of those dump files.
If endPageID is ommitted, all pages starting from startPageID will be copied.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-i\fR   \fB\-\-inpath\fR
full path to input file; if omitted, stdin will be used instead;
if input file ends in .gz or .bz2 the appropriate decompression
will be used
.TP
\fB\-o\fR,  \fB\-\-odir\fR
directory in which to write output file(s)
.TP
\fB\-f\fR,  \fB\-\-fspecs\fR
series of output file specifications
each file spec consists of:
filename:startpage:lastpage
where lastpage may be omitted in the last file spec; it is
presumed both that the start and end page id ranges are in
in ascending order, and that there is no overlap in the ranges.
You can think of this as a lazy person's splitxml.
