.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a MediaWiki XML 'stubs' file from from stdin and writes information about the revisions for
each of the pages.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-B\fR   \fB\-\-batch\fR
display cumulative numbers for the specified number of pages instead of each page
.TP
\fB\-C\fR   \fB\-\-cutoff\fR
display information only for pages with more revisions than the specified number
.PP
Flags:
.TP
\fB\-a\fR   \fB\-\-all\fR
display the page id for each revision for all namespaces; if this option is                    ommitted, the page id is not shown, and the revsion count is shown only for
pages in namespace 0
.TP
\fB\-b\fR   \fB\-\-bytes\fR
display the sum of byte lengths for the revisions for each page
.TP
\fB\-c\fR   \fB\-\-concise\fR
don't display field names in each line, and use : as the field separator
.TP
\fB\-m\fR   \fB\-\-maxrevlen\fR
display the max byte length for revisions of each page
.TP
\fB\-t\fR   \fB\-\-title\fR
display the page title for each page
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show this help message
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display the version of this program and exit
.PP
Note that some options may not make good sense used together. For example, one can use \fB\-\-batch\fR and
.HP
\fB\-\-title\fR togther but only the title of the last page in the aggregated batch will be displayed,
.PP
which is most likely not what you want.
